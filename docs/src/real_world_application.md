# Real World Application
In this section we explain in detail how we use this toolbox to print a real boat. 


## Resin Preparation
For the resin we use the commercial XXX which mainly consists of XXX.
As photo initiator we use TPO.
With a refractometer we measure the refractive index $n_\text{resin} = 1.4849$.

## Glass Vial
As glass vials we use simple cylindrical glass vial which are not quite optimized for optical applications.
With a measurement calliper we determine the router radius to be $R_\text{outer} = 8.3\mathrm{mm}$ and the inner radius
$R_\text{outer} = 7.6\mathrm{mm}$. The refractive index is roughly $n_\text{vial}=1.47$
